<h1>Making a syscall in xv6</h1>

<p>
This OS work is supposed to create a syscall, getreadcount(), to count any read operation during processes
</p>
<p>
There's a report about what I did to learn and code the syscall, and the work specification.
</p>
<p>
With make, inside /src/ directory, is possible to boot xv6 OS as well as manipulate processes, but on the work specifications there are also instructions available</p>
